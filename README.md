# Event Keeper

An application built to help plan and schedule for my partner and I. A continual work in progress. Hopefully a beta will be ready by Valentine's Day...

* A basic overview of desired functionality:
* A user can create an event
* An event will have a start date, an end date (if applicable), a start and end time (if applicable), a location, featured information, and a variety of tasks
* A task belongs to an event and will be assigned to a user
* A task will have a description, a due date, a complete boolean, and a notes section
* When a user is assigned a task, they will receive an email or text (maybe preferred communication setting is user profile)
* Both users can edit event details (eventually maybe a log of past changes should be kept)
* Visualization of events can be in calendar or list form

All of this is subject to change as things are built out and the inspiration for the project is let in on the surprise.
